Installation
************

Usually user could find (and use) command **sat** directly after a 'detar' installation of SALOME.

.. code-block:: bash

    tar -xf .../SALOME_xx.tgz
    cd SALOME_xx
    ls -l sat      # sat -> salomeTools/sat


Python package (scripts of salomeTools) actually remains in directory *salomeTools*.
